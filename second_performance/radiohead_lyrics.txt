How come I end up where I started
How come I end up where I belong
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the string
How come I end up where I started
How come I end up where I belong
Won't take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the string
You used to be alright
What happened?
Did the cat get your tongue
Did your string come undone
One by one
One by one
It comes to us all
It's as soft as your pillow
You used to be alright
What happened?
Etcetera etcetera

Are you such a dreamer,
To put the world to rights?
I'll stay home forever,
Where two and two always makes a five
I'll lay down the tracks,
Sandbag and hide,
January has April showers,
And two and two always makes a five
It's the Devil's way now,
There is no way out,
You can scream and you can shout,
It is too late now
Because you have not been
Payin' attention,

Yeah I feel it, I needed attention,
Payin' attention,

Yeah I love it, the attention,
Payin' attention,

I try to sing along,
I get it all wrong,
'Cause I'm not,
'Cause I'm not
I swat 'em like flies,
But like flies the buggers keep coming back
But I'm not,
Oh hail to the thief,
Oh hail to the thief
But I'm not,
But I'm not,
But I'm not,
But I'm not
Don't question my authority or put me in the dock,
'Cause I'm not,
'Cause I'm not
Oh go up to the king, and the sky is falling in,
But it's not,
But it's not
But it's not
Maybe not,
Maybe not
Bloom
Open your mouth wide
A universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive
So why does this still hurt?
Don't blow your mind with why
I'm moving out of orbit

Fake Plastic Trees
A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In the fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins
And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
Wears him out
She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run
And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted
All the time
All the time

It's what you feel now
What you ought to, what you ought to
Reasonable and sensible
Dead from the neck up
Because I'm stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
We thought you had it in you
But no, no, no

Exactly where do you get off

You've got a head full of feathers
You got melted to butter

Jigsaw falling into place
Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favorite song
As the magic disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back and focus again
The walls abandon shape
You've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the noise
The beat goes round and round
The beat goes round and round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
What's the point of instruments
Words are a sawed off shotgun
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Before you run away from me
Before you start unraveling
Before you take my mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance
Jigsaws falling into place
There is nothing to explain
You eye each other as you pass
She looks back, you look back
Not just once
Not just twice
Wish away the nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You've got a light you can feel it on your back
You've got a light you can feel it on your back

Can't get the stink off
He's been hanging around for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends
One day he'll get to you
And teach you how to be a holy cow
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's what really hurts
Is you do it to yourself, just you
You and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
Don't get my sympathy, hanging out the fifteenth floor
You've changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door
One day I'll get to you
And teach you how to get to purest hell
You do it to yourself you do
And that's what really hurts
Is you do it to yourself, just you
You and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself you do
And that's what really hurts
Is you do it to yourself just you
You and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself, whoa
Say, hey
You do it to yourself, you do it to yourself
Yeah, yeah, you do it to yourself, yes-yes, you
Do it to yourself

Knives Out
I want you to know
He's not coming back
Look into my eyes
I'm not coming back
So knives out
Cut him up
Don't look down
Shove it in your mouth
If you'd been a dog
They would have drowned you at birth
Look into my eyes
It's the only way you'll know I'm telling the truth
So knives out
Cut him up
Squash his head
Put him in the pot
I want you to know
He's not coming back
His blood is frozen
Still there is no point letting it go to waste
So knives out
Catch the mouse
Squash his head
Put him in the pot

Run around around around around around
Cut the kids in half

No Surprises
A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide
With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent
This is my final fit
My final bellyache
With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please
Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please

Flies are buzzing round my head
Vultures circling the dead
Picking up every last crumb
The big fish eat the little ones

Not my problem, give me some
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
This one's optimistic
This one went to market
This one just came out of the swamp
This one dropped a payload
Fodder for the animals
Living on animal farm
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
I'd really like to help you, man
I'd really like to help you, man
Nervous messed up marionettes
Floating around on a prison ship
You can try the best you can

The best you can is good enough

Please could you stop the noise
I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head
What's that?

When I am king, you will be first against the wall
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all
What's that?

Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking, squealing Gucci little piggy

Rain down, rain down (that's it, sir, you're leaving, the crackle of pigskin)
Come on rain down on me (the dust and the screaming, the yuppies networking)
From a great height (the panic, the vomit, the panic, the vomit)

I jumped in the river, what did I see?
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
I jumped into the river
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt
There was nothing to fear, nothing to doubt
There was nothing to fear, nothing to doubtThe Bends
Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now?
When I need you
Alone on an airplane
Falling asleep against the windowpane
My blood will thicken
I need to wash myself again
To hide all the dirt and pain
'Cause I'd be scared
That there's nothing underneath
And who are my real friends
Have they all got the bends?
Am I really sinking
This slow
My baby's got the bends
Oh, no
We don't have any real friends
No, no, no
Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
And I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen
Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you?
They brought in the C.I.A
The tanks and the whole marines to blow me away
To blow me sky-high
Baby's got the bends
We don't have any real friends
Just lying in a bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would-
I want to live, breathe
I want to be part of the human race
I want to live, breathe
I want to be part of the human race, race, race?
Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird, where are you now?
When I need you
There there (The Boney King of Nowhere)
In pitch dark
I go walking in your landscape
Broken branches
Trip me as I speak
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
There's always a siren
Singing you to shipwreck
(Don't reach out, don't reach out
Don't reach out, don't reach out)
Steer away from these rocks
We'd be a walking disaster
(Don't reach out, don't reach out
Don't reach out, don't reach out)
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder
Someone on your shoulder)
Just 'cause you feel it
Doesn't mean it's there
(Someone on your shoulder
Someone on your shoulder)
There there
Why so green and lonely?
And lonely, and lonely?
Heaven sent you to me
To me, to me?
We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen
We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen
Videotape
When I'm at the pearly gates
This will be on my videotape, my videotape
Mephistopheles is just beneath
And he's reaching up to grab me
This is one for the good days
And I have it all here
In red, blue, green
Red, blue, green
You are my center
When I spin away
Out of control on videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
On videotape
This is my way of saying goodbye
Because I can't do it face to face
I'm talking to you after it's too late
No matter what happens now
You shouldn't be afraid
Because I know today has been the most perfect day I've ever seen
Weird Fishes/Arpeggi
In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?
I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me on to phantoms
I follow to the edge of the earth
And fall off
Everybody leaves
If they get the chance
And this is my chance
I get eaten by the worms
Weird fishes
Get towed by the worms
Weird fishes
Weird fishes

I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
I'll hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape

You
You are the sun and moon and stars, are you
And I could never run away from you
You try at working out chaotic things
And why should I believe myself, not you?
It's like the world is going to end so soon
And why should I believe myself?
You, me and everything caught in the fire
I can see me drowning, caught in the fire
The earlier version finishes with the following:
Hey the sun and moon and stars are yeah..
But I won't share myself with you
You to me
CreepWhen you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fucking special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
Oh, oh
She's running out again
She's running out
She run run run run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
How Do You?
He's bitter and twisted
He knows what he wants
He wants to be loved and he wants to belong
He wants us to listen, he wants us to weep
And he was a stupid baby who turned into a powerful freak
But how do you?
How do you?
How do you?
He lives with his mother
But we show him respect
He's a dangerous bigot, but we always forget
And he's just like his daddy because he cheats on his friends
And he steals and he bullies anyway that he can
But how do you?
How do you?
How do you?
Stop Whispering
And the wise man say I don't want to hear your voice
And the thin man say I don't want to hear your voice
And they're cursing me, and they won't let me be
And there's nothing to say, and there's nothing to do
Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting
And the mother say we spit on your son some more
And the buildings say we spit on your face some more
And the feeling is that there's something wrong
Because I can't find the words and I can't find the songs
Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting
Dear Sir, I have a complaint
Can't remember what it is
It doesn't matter anyway
It doesn't matter anyway
Thinking About You
Been thinking about you, your record's a hit
Your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there
But I'm still no-one, and you're not a star
What do you care?
Been thinking about you, and there's no rest
Shit, I still love you, still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself, and what do you care
When the other men are far, far better
All the things you got
All the things you need
Who bought you cigarettes and bribed the company
To come and see you, honey
I've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep
These people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet
But they don't know what I know, and why should you care
When I'm not there
Been thinking about you, and there's no rest
Shit, I still love you, still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself, what do you care
When I'm not there
All the things you got, you'll never need
All the things you've got, I bled and I bleed to please you
Been thinking about you...
Anyone Can Play Guitar
Destiny, destiny protect me from the world
Destiny, hold my hand protect me from the world
Here we are with our running and confusion
And I don't see no confusion anywhere
And if the world does turn
And if London burns I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
I wanna be in a band when I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar
And they won't be a nothing anymore
Grow my hair, grow my hair
I am Jim Morrison
Grow my hair
I wanna be wanna be wanna be Jim Morrison
Here we are with our running and confusion
And I don't see no confusion anywhere
And if the world does turn
And if London burns I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
I wanna be in a band when I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar
And they won't be a nothing anymore

Vegetable
I never wanted anything but this
I tried hard, worked hard
I ran around in domestic bliss
I fought hard, died hard
Everytime you're running over me
Everytime you're running I can see
I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feeds me
I will not control myself
I never wanted any broken bones
Scarred face, no home
Your words surround me and I asphyxiate
And I burn all hate
Everytime you're running out on me
Everytime you're running I can see
I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feeds me
I will not control myself
The waters break, the waters run all over me
The waters break, the waters run
And this time you're gonna pay
I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feeds me
I will not control myself…
Prove Yourself
I can't afford to breathe in this time
Nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand
Hooked back up to the cathode ray
I'm better off dead
I'm better off dead
I'm better off
Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself
I wanna breathe, I wanna grow
I'd say I want it but I don't know how
I work, I bleed, I beg and I pray
But I'm better off dead
I'm better off dead
I'm better off
Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Why?
I Can't
Please forget the words that I just blurted out
It wasn't me, it was my strange and creeping doubt
It keeps rattling my cage
And there's nothing in this world will keep it down
Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
So many things that keep, that keep me underground
So many words that I, that I can never find
If you give up on me now I'll be gutted like I've never been before
And even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
If you give up on me now I'll be gutted like I've never been before
And even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
Lurgee
I feel better, 
I feel better now you've gone
I got better, 
I got better, I got strong
And I feel better, 
I feel better now there's nothing wrong
I got better, 
I got better, I got strong
Tell me something, 
Tell me something I don't know
Tell me one thing, 
Tell me one thing and let it go
I've got something, 
I've got something heaven knows
I got something, 
I got something I don't know
Blow Out
In my mind
And nailed into my heels
All the time
Killing what I feel
And everything I touch
(all wrapped up in cotton wool)
(all wrapped up in sugar-coated pills)
Turns to stone
Everything I touch
(all wrapped up in cotton wool)
(all wrapped up in sugar-coated pills)
Turns to stone
I am fused
Just in case I blow out
I am glued
Just in case I crack out
And everything I touch turns to stone
Everything I touch
(all wrapped up in cotton wool)
(all wrapped up in sugar-coated pills)
Turns to stone
My Iron Lung
Faith, you're driving me away
You do it everyday
You don't mean it
But it hurts like hell
My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen
From my life support
My iron lung
We're too young to fall asleep
Too cynical to speak
We are losing it
Can't you tell?
We scratch our eternal itch
A twentieth century bitch
And we are grateful for
Our iron lung
The headshrinkers, they want everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
Suck, suck your teenage thumb
Toilet trained and dumb
When the power runs out
We'll just hum
This, this is our new song
Just like the last one
A total waste of time
My iron lung
The headshrinkers, they want everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
And if you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's OK
And if you're frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, it's OK
The headshrinkers, they want everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The Trickster
Rust in the mountains
Rust in the brain
The air is sacred here
In spite of your claim
Up on the the rooftops
Out of reach
Trickster is meaningless
Trickster is weak
He's talking out the world
Talking out the world
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
I wanted you so bad
That I couldn't say
These things fall apart
We wanted out so bad
That we couldn't say
All things fall apart
We're talking out the world
Talking out the world
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
Truant kids
A can of brick dust worms
Who do not want to climb down from
Their chestnut tree
Long white gloves
Police check carefully
Escaped from the zoo
The perfect child facsimile is
Talking out the world
Talking out the world
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Lewis (Mistreated)
Bummed out again by your only business friend
The smell of fear is thicker than you think
Don't do it
Don't jump
Changed shape to fit
In the end you just feel sick
A million love songs under anaesthetic
Hey don't do it
Don't jump
Lewis
Save yourself the pain
You'll never get there
Lewis
Save yourself the pain
It never really mattered
We never noticed
We never understood
He just get crushed to fit
He never even smelt out the best
It's the best
It's the best day of your life
Lewis
Save yourself the pain
You'll never get there
Lewis
Save yourself the pain
It never really mattered
No
I swear
I swear
I swear
Oh
Mistreated
A low corporate
Mistreated
A low corporate
I don't wanna to talk about it
I don't wanna to talk about it
I don't wanna to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis
I don't wanna to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis
Punchdrunk Lovesick Singalong
I wrapped you inside my coat 
When they came to firebomb the house 
I didn't feel pain, 'cause no-one can touch me 
Now that I'm held in your spell 
A beautiful girl 
A beautiful girl 
Can turn your world into dust
Sell me a car that goes 
Sell me a house that stands 
I never cared before, I never cared before 
I never cared before, before, before, before 
A beautiful girl 
A beautiful girl 
Can turn your world into dust
A beautiful girl 
A beautiful girl 
Can turn your world into dust 
I stood in front of her face 
When the first bullet was shot
Permanent Daylight
The easiest way to sleep at night
Is to carry on believing that I don't exist
The easiest way to sell your soul
is to carry on believing we don't exist
It must be hard
With your head on backwards
Lozenge Of Love
I am gone
Everybody's raging
And these fruits
They still taste of poison
I won't be around
When you really need me
I can't sleep
Why can't someone hold me
I need warmth
A restless body cracks some more
I won't have the strength
When you really need me
You Never Wash Up After Yourself
I must get out once in a while
Everything is starting to die
The dust settles
The worms dig
Spiders crawl over the bedPlanet Telex
You can force it but it will not come
You can taste it but it will not form
You can crush it but it's always here
You can crush it but it's always near
Chasing you home saying
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken
You can force it but it will stay stung
You can crush it as dry as a bone
You can walk it home straight from school
You can kiss it, you can break all the rules
But still...
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken
Everyone is, everyone is broken
Everyone is, everything is broken
Why can't you forget?
Why can't you forget?
Why can't you forget?
I must get out once in a while
I eat all day and now I'm fat
Yesterday's meal is hugging the plates
You never wash up after yourself
The Bends
Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now, when I need you
Alone on an aeroplane
Fall asleep on against the window pane
My blood will thicken
I need to wash myself again to hide all the dirt and pain
'Cause I'd be scared that there's nothing underneath
But who are my real friends?
Have they all got the bends?
Am I really sinking this low?
My baby's got the bends, oh no
We don't have any real friends, no, no, no
Just lying in the bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen
Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you?
They brought in the CIA, the tanks and the whole marines
To blow me away, to blow me sky high
My baby's got the bends
We don't have any real friends
Just lying in the bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen
I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be part of the human race
I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be part of the human race, race, race, race
Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you?
High & Dry
Two jumps in a week
I bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you boy?
Flying on your motorcycle,
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition,
Kill yourself to never ever stop
You broke another mirror,
You're turning into something you are not
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Drying up in conversation,
You'll be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces,
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you,
You'll be the one screaming out
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
It's the best thing that you ever had,
The best thing that you ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you ever had,
The best thing you have had has gone away
So, don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high,
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Bones
I don't want to be crippled cracked
Shoulders, wrists, knees and back
Ground to dust and ash
Crawling on all fours
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones
Now I can't climb the stairs
Pieces missing everywhere
Prozak painkillers
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones
And I used to fly like peter pan
All the children flew when I touched their hands
When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones
Nice Dream
They love me like I was a brother
They protect me, listen to me
They dug me my very own garden
Gave me sunshine, made me happy
Nice dream, nice dream, nice dream
I call up my friend, the good angel
But she's out with her answerphone
She says that she'd love to come help but
The sea would electrocute us all
Nice dream 
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
If you think that you're strong enough
If you think you belong enough
If you think that you're strong enough
If you think you belong enough
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Nice dream
Bulletproof... I Wish I Was
Limb by limb and tooth by tooth
Tearing up inside of me
Every day every hour
I wish that I was bullet proof
Wax me
Mould me
Heat the pins and stab them in
You have turned me into this
Just wish that it was bullet proof
So pay the money and take a shot
Leadfill the hole in me
I could burst a million bubbles
All surrogate and bullet proof
And bullet proof
And bullet proof
And bullet proof
Black Star
I get home from work and you're still standing in your dressing gown
Well what am I to do?
I know all the things around your head and what they do to you
What are we coming to?
What are we gonna do?
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home
The troubled words of a troubled mind I try to understand what is eating you
I try to stay awake but its 58 hours since that I last slept with you
What are we coming to?
I just don't know anymore
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home
I get on the train and I just stand about now that I don't think of you
I keep falling over I keep passing out when I see a face like you
What am I coming to?
I'm gonna melt down
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that beams me home
This is killing me
This is killing me
Sulk
You bite through the big wall, the big wall bites back
You just sit there and sulk, sit there and bawl
You are so pretty when you're on your knees
Disinfected, eager to please
Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes and we've already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change
Each time it comes it eats me alive
I try to behave but it eats me alive
So I declare a holiday
Fall asleep, drift away
Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes and we've already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change
Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes and we've already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change
Street Spirit (Fade Out)
Rows of houses, all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out
This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under
And fade out again and fade out again
Cracked eggs, dead birds
Scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out again
Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in love
Airbag
In the next world war
In a jackknifed juggernaut 
I am born again 
In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In a deep deep sleep of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast german car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
Subterranean Homesick Alien
The breath of the morning
I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town
Where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet
For cracks in the pavement
Up above
Aliens hover
Making home movies
For the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures
Who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves
And live for their secrets
They're all uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it
I'd tell all my friends
But they'd never believe me
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars
And the meaning of life
They'd shut me away
But I'd be all right
All right…
I'm just uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Uptight
Exit Music (For A Film)
Wake... from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape, we escape
Pack… and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell breaks loose
Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone
Sing... us a song
A song to keep us warm
There's such a chill, such a chill
You can laugh
A spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you
Now we are one in everlasting peace
We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke
Let Down
Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people clinging on to bottles
And when it comes it's so so disappointing
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel
One day I'm going to grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and ...
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Let down again
Let down again
Let down again
You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapsing
Floating, bouncing back
And one day....
I am going to grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and...
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Electioneering
I will stop
I will stop at nothing
Say the right things
When electioneering
I trust I can rely on your vote
When I go forwards you go backwards and somewhere we will meet
Riot shields
Voodoo economics
It's just business
Cattle prods and the IMF
I trust I can rely on your vote
When I go forwards you go backwards and somewhere we will meet
Climbing Up The Walls
I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement.
And if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection.
It's always best when the candle's out,
I am the pick in the ice.
Do not cry out or hit the alarm,
You know we're friends 'til we die.
And either way you turn
I'll be there
Open up your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
It's always best when the light is off,
It's always better on the outside.
Fifteen blows to the back of your head,
Fifteen blows to your mind.
So lock the kids up safe tonight
And shut the eyes in the cupboard.
I've got the smell of a local man
Who's got the loneliest feeling.
That either way he turns - I'll be there
Open up your skull - I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Lucky
I'm on a roll, I'm on a roll
This time, I feel my luck could change
Kill me Sarah, kill me again with love
It's gonna be a glorious day
Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
'Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge
The Head of State has called for me by name
But I don't have time for him
It's gonna be a glorious day
I feel my luck could change
Pull me out of the aircrash
Pull me out of the lake
'Cause I'm your superhero
We are standing on the edge
We are standing on the edge
The Tourist
It barks at no one else but me
Like it's seen a ghost
I guess it seen the sparks a-flowing
No one else would know
Hey man slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow down
Sometimes I get overcharged
That's when you see sparks
You ask me where the hell I'm going
At a thousand feet per second
Hey man slow down, slow down
Idiot slow down, slow down
Hey man slow down, slow down
Idiot slow down, slow down
Kid A
I slipped away
I slipped on a little white lie
We got heads on sticks
You got ventriloquists
We got heads on sticks
You got ventriloquists
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed [x4]
Rats and children follow me out of town
Rats and children follow me out of town
Come on kids...
The National Anthem
Everyone
Everyone around here
Everyone is so near
What's going on?
What's going on?
Everyone
Everyone is so near
Everyone has got the fear
It's holding on
It's holding on
It's holding on
It's holding on
It's holding on
It's holding on
How To Disappear Completely
That there, that's not me
I go where I please
I walk through walls
I float down the Liffey
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here, I'm not here
In a little while
I'll be gone
The moment's already passed
Yeah, it's gone
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here, I'm not here
Strobe lights and blown speakers
Fireworks and hurricanes
I'm not here
This isn't happening
I'm not here, I'm not here...
In Limbo
I'm the first in the Irish Sea
Another message I can't read
I'm on your side
Nowhere to hide
Trapdoors that open
I spiral down
You're living in a fantasy world
You're living in a fantasy world
I'm lost at sea
Don't bother me
I've lost my way
I've lost my way
You're living in a fantasy world [x3]
This beautiful world I'm the first in the Irish Sea
Another message I can't read
Morning Bell
Morning bell
Morning bell
Light another candle
Release me
Release me
You can keep the furniture
A bump on the head
Coming down the chimney
Release me
Release me
Please...
Release me
Release me
Where'd you park the car?
Where'd you park the car?
Clothes are all over the furniture
Now I might as well
I might as well
Sleepy jack the fire drill
Run around around around around around....
Cut the kids in half
The lights are on but nobody's home
Everybody wants to be a
The lights are on but nobody's home
Nobody wants to be a slave
Walking walking walking walking...
The lights are on but nobody's home
Everybody wants to be a
Everyone wants to be a friend
Nobody wants to be a slave
Walking walking walking walking...
Motion Picture Soundtrack
Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
It's not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies
I think you're crazy, maybe
I think you're crazy, maybe
I will see you in the next life
Packt Like Sardines In A Crushed Tin Box
After years of waiting nothing came
As your life flashed before your eyes
You realize
I'm a reasonable man
Get off, get off, get off my case
Get off, get off, get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case
Get off my case
After years of waiting
After years of waiting nothing came
And you realize you're looking,
Looking in the wrong place
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case 
Get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case 
Get off my case
I'm a reasonable man
Get off my case 
Get off my case
Get off my case
After years of waiting
You're a reasonable man
Get off my case 
Get off my case
Get off my case
I'm a reasonable man,
Get off my case 
Get off my case
Get off my case
I'm a reasonable man,
Get off my case 
Get off my case
Get off my case
I'm a reasonable man,
Get off my case 
Get off my case
Get off my case
Pyramid Song
I jumped in the river and what did I see?
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
All the things I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
I jumped into the river
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the things I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt 
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
Pull / Pulk Revolving Doors
There are barn doors
And there are revolving doors
Doors on the rudders of big ships
We are revolving doors
There are doors that open by themselves
There are sliding doors
And there are secret doors
There are doors that lock
And doors that don't
There are doors that let you in
And out
But never open
But they are trapdoors
That you can't come back from
You And Whose Army?
Come on, come on
You think you drive me crazy
Come on, come on
You and whose army?
You and your cronies
Come on, come on
Holy roman empire
Come on if you think
Come on if you think
You can take us all on
You can take us all on
You and whose army?
You and your cronies
You forget so easily
We ride tonight
We ride tonight
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
Ghost horses
We ride tonight

I Might Be Wrong
I might be wrong
I might be wrong
I could have sworn
I saw a light coming on
I used to think
I used to think
There is no future left at all
I used to think
Open up, begin again
Let's go down the waterfall
Think about the good times
And never look back
Never look back
What would I do?
What would I do?
If I did not have you?
Open up, let me in
Let's go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time
It's nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all

Dollars And Cents
There are better things to talk about,
Be constructive.
Bear witness we can use,
Be constructive with your blues.
Even when it's only warnings.
Even when you turn the water green.
Why won't you quiet down? 
Maybe I want peace and honesty
Why won't you quiet down?
Maybe I want to live in the children's land
And you know maybe, maybe I
Why won't you quiet down? 
Maybe I'll wander the promised land
I want peace and honesty
Why won't you quiet down?
I want to live in the promised land
And maybe wander the children's land
Quiet down! Yeah, and there, there we can free
You don't live in a business world
And you never go out and you never stay.
We all have goals in a liberal world,
Living in times when I could stand it, babe.
All over, baby's crying
It'll all be, baby, I can see out of here,
All over the planet's dead,
All over the planet, so let me out of here.
All over the, all over the, all over the, all over the...
Quiet down
We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence
And the mark and the yen, and yeah
Why won't you quiet down?
We're gonna crack your little souls
We're gonna crack your little souls
Why won't you quiet down?
We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence
And the pounds and pence, and yeah
Why won't you quiet down?
We're gonna crack your little souls
Crack your little souls
We are the dollars and cents.
Like Spinning Plates
While you make pretty speeches,
I'm being cut to shreds
You feed me to the lions,
a delicate balance
And this just feels like spinning plates
I'm living in cloud cuckoo land
And this just feels like spinning plates
My body is floating down the muddy river.
Life In A Glass House
Once again, I'm in trouble with my only friend
She is papering the window panes
She is putting on a smile
Living in a glass house
Once again, packed like frozen food and battery hens
Think of all the starving millions
Don't talk politics and don't throw stones
Your royal highnesses
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
But someone's listening in.
Once again, we are hungry for a lynching 
That's a strange mistake to make
You should turn the other cheek
Living in a glass house
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
But someone's listening in.

Sail To The Moon
I sail to the moon
I spoke too soon
And how much did it cost
I was dropped from
The moonbeam
And sailed on shooting stars
Maybe you'll
Be president
But know right from wrong
Or in the flood
You'll build an Ark
And sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
Backdrifts
We're rotten fruit
We're damaged goods
What the hell we've got nothing more to lose
One burst and we will probably crumble
We're backdrifting
This far but no further
I'm hanging off a branch
I'm teetering on a breaker
Honey sweets so fall asleep
I'm backsliding
You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do
All evidence has been buried
All tapes have been erased
But your footsteps give you away
So you're backtracking
Oh oh oh
You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do
You fell into our
You fell into a
We're rotten fruit
We're damaged goods
What the hell we've got nothing more to lose
One burst and we will probably crumble
We're backdrifters
Go To Sleep
Something for the rag and bone man
Over my dead body
Something big is gonna happen
Over my dead body 
Someone saw someone's daughter
Over my dead body
This is how I ended up sucked in
Over my dead body
I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me
We don't really want a monster taking over
Tip toeing, tying down
We don't want the loonies takin' over
Tip toeing, tying down our arms
May pretty horses
Come to you as you sleep
I'm gonna go to sleep
And let this wash over me
Where I End And You Begin
There's a gap in between
There's a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin
And I'm sorry for us
The dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin
I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I can't and I can't come down
I can watch and cant take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone
X'll mark the place
Like the parting of the waves
Like a house falling in the sea
In the sea
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
There'll be no more lies
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive
We Suck Young Blood
Are you hungry?
Are you sick?
Are you begging for a break?
Are you sweet?
Are you fresh?
Are you strung up by the wrists?
We want the young blood
Are you fracturing?
Are you torn at the seams?
Would you do anything?
Fleabitten motheaten?
We suck young blood
We suck young blood
Woah woah
Won't let the creeping ivy
Won't let the nervous bury me
Our veins are thin
Our rivers poisoned
We want the sweet meat
We want the young blood
I Will
I will
Lay me down
In a bunker
Underground
I won't let this happen to my children
Meet the real world coming out of your shell
With white elephants
Sitting ducks
I will
rise up
Little babies eyes eyes eyes eyes
Little babies eyes eyes eyes eyes
Little babies eyes eyes eyes eyes
Little babies eyes eyes eyes

I don't know why you bother
Nothing's ever good enough for you
(By the way) I was there and it wasn't like that
You've come here just to start a fight
You had to piss on our parade
You had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned
In a drunken punch-up at a wedding
Yeah
Hypocrite opportunist
Don't infect me with your poison
A bully in a china shop
When I turn 'round you stay frozen to the spot
You had the pointless snide remarks
Of hammerheaded sharks
The pot will call the kettle black
It's a drunken punch-up at a wedding yeah
Oh no no
Myxomatosis
The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his new found friends
He said I been where I liked
I slept with who I like
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice
But now
I don't know why
I feel so tongue-tied
I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down real neat 
They were cheering and waving
Cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited fucked up
Strangled beaten up
Used in a photo in time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in devon
I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
Don't know why
I feel
So skinned alive.
My thoughts are misguided and a little naive
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis
I got myxomatosis
Yeah no one likes a smart ass but we all like stars
But that wasn't my intention, I did it for a reason
It must have got mixed up
Strangled beaten up
I got myxomatosis 
I got myxomatosis
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue-tied
Scatterbrain
I'm walking out in a force ten gale
Birds thrown around, bullets for hail
The roof is pulling off by its fingernails
Your voice is rattlin' on my window sill
Yesterday's headlines blown by the wind
Yesterday's people end up scatterbrain
Any fool can easy pick a hole I only wish I could fall in
A moving target in a firing range
Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain
Somewhere I'm not
Scatterbrain
Lightning fuse, powercut
Scatterbrain
A Wolf At The Door
Drag him out your window
Dragging out the dead
Singing I miss you
Snakes and ladders
Flip the lid
Out pops the cracker
Smacks you in the head
Knifes you in the neck
Kicks you in the teeth
Steel toe caps
Takes all your credit cards
Get up get the gunge
Get the eggs
Get the flan in the face
The flan in the face
The flan in the face
Dance you fucker dance you fucker
Don't you dare
Don't you dare
Don't you flan in the face
Take it where the love is given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the taxman
Let me back let me back
I promise to be good
Don't look in the mirror
At the face you don't recognize
Help me call the doctor
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
Put me inside
I keep the wolf from the door
He calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children
If I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again
If I squeal to the cops
No no no no no no no
Walking like giant cranes ah
With my X-ray eyes I strip you naked
In a tight little world and why are you on the list?
Stepford wives who are we to complain?
Investments and dealers investments and dealers
Cold wives and mistresses
Cold wives and Sunday papers
City boys in first class
Don't know they're born little
Someone else is gonna come and clean it up
Born and raised for the job
Someone always does
I wish you'd get up get over get up get over
Turn your tape off
I keep the wolf from the door
He calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that he's gonna mess me up
Steal all my children
If I don't pay the ransom
And I'll never see them again
If I squeal to the cops
So I'm just gonna go oh
Bodysnatchers
I do not
Understand
What it is
I've done wrong
Full of holes
Check for pulse
Blink your eyes
One for yes
Two for no
I have no idea what I am talking about
I am trapped in this body and can't get out
You killed the sound
Removed backbone
A pale imitation
With the edges sawn off
I have no idea what you are talking about
Your mouth moves only with someone's hand up your ass
Has the light gone out for you?
Because the light's gone out for me
It is the 21st century
It is the 21st century
It can follow you like a dog
It brought me to my knees
They got a skin and they put me in
They got a skin and they put me in
On the lines wrapped around my face
On the lines wrapped around my face
Are for anyone else to see
Are for anyone else to see
I'm a lie
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
I've seen it coming
Nude
Don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
But there'll be something missing
Now that you've found it, it's gone
Now that you feel it, you don't
You've gone off the rails
So don't get any big ideas
They're not gonna happen
You'll go to hell
For what your dirty mind is thinking
All I Need
I'm the next act
Waiting in the wings
I'm an animal
Trapped in your hot car
I am all of the days
That you choose to ignore
You are all I need
You are all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
I am a moth
Who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect
Trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you
Because there are no others
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
It's all wrong
It's alright
It's all wrong
It's alright
Reckoner
Reckoner
You can't take it with yer
Dancing for your pleasure
You are not to blame for
Bittersweet dis-tractor
Dare not speak its name
Dedicated to all human beings
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
In rainbows
Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
Reckoner, take me with yer
Dedicated to all human beings
House Of Cards
I don't wanna be your friend
I just wanna be your lover
No matter how it ends
No matter how it starts
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Fall off the table
And get swept under
Denial, denial
The infrastructure will collapse
From voltage spikes
Throw your keys in the bowl
Kiss your husband 'goodnight'
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Forget about your house of cards
And I'll do mine
Fall off the table
And get swept under
Denial, denial
Denial, denial
Your ears should be burning
Denial, denial
Your ears should be burning
Denial...
Down Is The New Up
Get yourself together
Let the light pour in 
Pour yourself a hot bath, pour yourself a drink
Nothing's gonna happen without a warning
Down is the new up
What is up, buttercup
Down is the new up, is the new up
Your services are not required
Your future's bleak, you're so last week
Ladies and gentlemen, without a safety net
I shall now perform a 180 flip-flop
I shall now amputate, I shall now contort
Because down is the new up
What if I just flip-flopped?
Down is the new up
Down is the new up
Down is the new up, is the new up
You're on Candid Camera
The chink in your armor
Topsy turvy town, topsy turvy town
Shake your pockets out
Pass it on, pass it down
Topsy turvy town, topsy turvy town
Go Slowly
Over here
Come slowly
Come slowly to me
I've been waiting
Patient
Patiently
I didn't care
But now I can see
That there's a way out
That there's a way out
That there's a way out
That there's a way out
That there's a way out
Last Flowers
Appliances have gone berserk
I cannot keep up
Treading on people's toes
Snot-nosed little punk
And I can't face the evening straight
You can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Relief, relief, relief, relief...
And if I'm gonna talk
I just wanna talk
Please don't interrupt
Just sit back and listen
'Cause I can't face the evening straight
You can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak
If you take me there you'll get relief
Relief, relief, relief, relief...
It's too much
Too bright
Too powerful
Too much
Too bright
Too powerful
Too much
Too bright
Too powerful
Too much
Too bright
Too powerful
Up On The Ladder
I'm stuck in the Tardis
Trapped in hyperspace
One minute snake charming
The next in a motorcade
All the right moves and
In the right places
Watch me dance, I'm a puppet
You can almost see the strings
Give me an answer
Give me a lie
I've been climbing up this ladder
I've been wasting my time
Up on the ladder
We're all tied to a stake
Up on the ladder
We wait for your mistake
Up on the ladder
Try to call out your name
Up on the ladder
You're all the fucking same
Bangers And Mash
You bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
You bit me, bit me and I want more
I'm standing in the hall, I'm puking on the wall
It's all heading south to the Conger Hill
The bangers in the mash, the negatives for cash
You're either in the club, baby, or you're not
Whatever turns you on, whatever gets you up
Chief of Police or Vice Chancellor
Lord and Lady blah blah, the vicar and the judge
You're all dancing to my little red book
Because you bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
I got the poison, poison and now I want more
If you are on the top then it is a long drop
The pyramid is power, we're changing by the hour
If you are on the top then it is a long drop
If you stare into the dark the dark will stare back
Back into your soul
I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down when I go down
I'm taking you down, I'm taking you down
I'm standing in the hall, I'm puking on the wall
Yeah, because you bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
The poison, I got the poison, I got the poison now
Yeah, I got the poison
4 Minute Warning
This is just a nightmare
But soon I'm going to wake up
Someone's gonna bring me around
Running from the bombers
Hiding in the forest
Running through the fields
Laying flat on the ground
Just like everybody
Stepping over heads
Running through the underground
This is your warning
4 minute warning
I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna know
I just wanna run and hide
This is just a nightmare
But soon I'm gonna wake up
Someone's gonna bring me 'round
This is a warning
4 minute warning
Bloom
Open your mouth wide
The universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive
So why does it still hurt?
Don't blow your mind with why
I'm moving out of orbit
Turning in somersaults
A giant turtle's eyes
Jellyfish swim by
Morning Mr Magpie
You got some nerve, coming here
You got some nerve, coming here
You stole it all, give it back
You stole it all, give it back
Good Morning, Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
And now you stole it, all the magic
took my memories
Ooohhhh
No no no no no no
You know you should, but you don't
You know you should, but you don't
Good Morning, Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
And now you stole it, all the magic
took my melody
Little By Little
Turn to nasty now
The dark cell
The pit of my soul
The last one out of the box
The one who broke this spell
Little by little by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease
And you're such a flirt
Once you've been hurt
You've been around enough
Little by little by hook or by crook
Never get nervous
Never get judged
I'm no idiot
I should look
Your clue on hold, snapped up
Crawling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one that broke the seal
Obligation
Complication
Routines and schedules
Drug and kill you
Kill you
Little by little by hook or by crook
Never get nervous
Never get judged
I'm no idiot
I should look
Lotus Flower
I will shape myself into your pocket
Invisible, do what you want, do what you want
I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove and cut me up, and cut me up
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
And now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
Tonight I'll set you free
I'll set you free
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart
We will shrink and be quiet as mice
While the cat is away; do what we want
Do what we want
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I set you free
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
Put the lotus flower into my room
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around a pit
The darkness is beneath
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart
Codex
Sleight of hand
Jump off the end
Into a clear lake
No one around
Just dragonflies
Fantasize
No one gets hurt
You’ve done nothing wrong
Slide your hand
Jump off the end
The water's clear and innocent
The water's clear and innocent
Give Up The Ghost
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
Gather up the lost and sold (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
Gather up the pitiful (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
What seems impossible (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
I think I have had my fill (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
I think I should give up the ghost (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)

It's like I'm falling out of bed
From a long, weary dream
The sweetest flowers and fruits hang from the trees
Falling off the giant bird that’s been carrying me
It's like I'm falling out of bed from a long and weary dream
Just exactly as I remember
Every word
Every gesture
I'm a heart in cold ground
Like I'm falling out of bed
From a long and weary dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying
Every woman blows her cover
In the eye of the beholder
I'm a fish now out of water
Falling off a giant bird that's been carrying me
I fell open
I laid under
At the tip out
I was just a number
I wanna slip it over
And get back under
And if you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over
Then you're wrong
Wake me up, wake me up
If you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over
Then you're wrong
Wake me up, wake me up
Like I'm falling out of bed from a long and weary dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying
When I ask you again
When I ask you again
Wake me up, wake me up

Daydreaming
Dreamers
They never learn
They never learn
Beyond the point
Of no return
Of no return
And it's too late

This goes
Beyond me
Beyond you
The white room
By window
Where the sun goes
Through
We are
Just happy to serve
Just happy to serve

Stay in the shadows
Cheer at the gallows
This is a round up
This is a low flying panic attack
Sing a song on the jukebox that goes
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
Red crosses on wooden doors
And if you float you burn
Loose talk around tables
Abandon all reason
Avoid all eye contact
Do not react
Shoot the messengers
This is a low flying panic attack
Sing the song of sixpence that goes
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
We know where you live
Decks Dark
Then into our life, there comes the darkness
There's a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard
And all we trapped rag doll cloth people
We are helpless to resist
Into our darkest hour
But it was just a laugh, just a laugh, just a laugh, just a laugh
Even at this angle
And so we crumble
A ten-ton head made of wet sand
Oh, this dread circumference
You've gotta be kidding me
The grass grows over me
Your face in the glass, in the glass
It was just a laugh, just a laugh
It's whatever you say it is
In split infinities
Then into your life, there comes the darkness
There's a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And there's nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
It's the loudest sound you've ever heard
Into our darkest hour
Have you had enough of me?
Have you had enough of me
Sweet darling
Have you had enough of me?
Have you had enough of me?
Sweet darling
Sweet time
Sweet dark
Sweet dark
Desert Island Disk
Now as I go upon my way
So let me go upon my way
Born of a light
Born of a light
The wind rushing round my open heart
An open ravine
With my spirit white
Totally alive
And my spirit light
Through an open doorway
Across a street
To another life
And catching my reflection in a window
Switching on a light
One I didn't know
Totally alive
Totally released
Waking, waking up from shutdown
From a thousand years of sleep
Yeah you, you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
Standing on the edge of you
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
Different types of love
Different types of love
Different types of love

Ful Stop
You really messed up everything
You really messed up everything
If you could take it all back again
Strike up what's in the box
Why should I be good if you're not?
This is a foul tasting medicine
A foul tasting medicine
To be trapped in your full stop
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up
Truth will mess you up

Glass Eyes
Hey it's me
I just got off the train
A frightening place
The faces are concrete grey
And I'm wondering, should I turn around?
Buy another ticket
Panic is coming on strong
So cold, from the inside out
No great drama, message coming in
In the oh-so-smug
Glassy eyed light of day
Glassy eyed light of day
Where the path trails off
And heads down the mountain
Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads
I don't really care
And the path trails off
And heads down a mountain
Through the dry bush, I don't know where it leads
I don't really care
I feel this love to the core
I feel this love to the core
Identikit
A moon-shaped pool, dancing clothes,
You love and now I know, but hold me, hold me.
Sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love
That we all can love
That we all...
Sweet-faced ones with nothing left inside
That we all can love
That we all can love
That we all...
And now I see you messing me around
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
And now I see you messing me around
I don't want to know
I don't want to know
I don't want to know

Pieces of a ragdoll mankind
That you can't create

But when I see you messing me around
And I don't want to know
I don't want to know

And I don't want to know
I don't want to know

The Numbers
It holds us like a phantom
The touch is like a breeze
It shines its understanding
See the moon smiling
Open on all channels
Ready to receive
And we're not at the mercy
Of your shimmerers or spells
Your shimmerers or spells
Mmmhm
We are of the earth
To her we do return
The future is inside us
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
It's not somewhere else
(One day at a time)
One day at a time
We call upon the people
People have this power
The numbers don't decide
Your system is a lie
The river running dry
The wings of a butterfly
And you may pour us away like soup
Like we're pretty broken flowers
We'll take back what is ours
Take back what is ours
One day at a time
Present Tense
This Dance
This Dance
Is like a weapon
Like a weapon
Of self defense
Self defense
Against the present
Against the present
Present tense
I won't get heavy
Don't get heavy
Keep it light and
Keep it moving
I am doing
No harm
As my world
Comes crashing down
I'll be dancing
Freaking out
Deaf, dumb, and blind
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
I won't turn around when the penny drops
I won't stop now
I won't slack off
Or all this love
Will be in vain
To stop from falling
Down a mine
It's no one's business but mine
Where all this love
Has been in vain
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
In you I'm lost
Tinker Tailor Soldier Sailor Rich Man Poor Man Beggar Man Thief
All the holes at once are coming alive, set free
Out of sight and out of mind
The lonely and their prey
The ones you light your fires to keep away
Crawling out upon its belly
And all you have to do is say Yes
All the birds stay up in the trees
All the fish swim down to the deep
The lonely and their prey
I am here, come to me before it's too late
The one you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon its belly
All you have to do is say Yes
True Love Waits
I'll drown my beliefs
To have your babies
I'll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet
Just don't leave
Don't leave
I'm not living, I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands, your crazy-kitten smile
Just don't leave
Don't leave
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps
Just don't leave
Don't leave
