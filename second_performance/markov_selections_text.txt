In red baby, or speakers 
I wanna know today?, 
You've got something big is not confusion a bug in sun away out all,
Think that I'd been around around enough is eating the dark,
You remember my drip feeds me,
Nowhere wrong we got myself, no return,
I am her me,
I get up get swept under anaesthetic,
Everything on the worms,
efil ym fathing,
Take themselves and cents and standing on the weeds taking over toys for the words and sometimes,\n
We don't know I know,
Why don't reach out, don't leave,
Do what I'm not,
Your face the wally sympatten you?,
There there'll be no more lies,
The one like a quiet down (that's what I had),
You're lost myself, yes-yes, your mouth will mess you up,
Suck, sucking on people,
That the the world in the can't gets so last as I'd lone,
In the thing walking sky,
So why shout,
Your dance are free unborn little by thout, done,
But I'm a hearts makes and the head,
And to little pland you know when I'm no righ,
Denial, denial, denial,
Turn climbing time,
Breath you park the new found and emptiest want everythings into the heads down, I'm not want a perfect,
He talk about you take it but no, no, no
From the moon full over can't hurts.
